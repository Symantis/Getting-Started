##The Symantis Philosophy and Code of Conduct


###What is Symantis?

Symantis is a system. To join, a person creates a Symantis account to become a Symantis User. A user is able to use the Symantis Creator App which builds robust "Realtime" Single Page Web Apps (SPWA). When something is built in the Creator App each component in the Symantis Project becomes a Manti. These Manti are micro repositories that contain design and development elements. Each time a Manti is created it is time stamped with the user's Symantis Signature and is then added to a Manti Tracker, much like a Torrent Tracker, and is seeded directly from the user's system. The Manti Tracker is spread across a block chain that is common in Crypto Currencies. Each time a Manti is "forked" and used by another user they also seed the orignal Manti and their Symantis Signature is added to the time stamp in the block chain.

The block chain is maintained and validated by other users who are using the program Symantis Myner. When a block in the chain is validated it produces Myner Coins. Users who are seeding Manti have priority in their Myner hash pools based on the number of other users who have forked thier Manti. This means the more a Manti is being forked and seeded the higher chance that a user will receive Myner Coins for their popular Manti. Myner Coins are similar to Litecoins and are transferred to the Manti seeders when forking Manti or when setting bounties for Symantis projects, components, etc... Users have the option of encrpyting their Manti so that they will not be private, but to do so, they give up their priority in Myner for their Manti and must exchange Myner Coins. Non-encrpyted Manti are created with the understanding that they belong to the original creator(s) but unlimited permissions are granted to copy and alter to any other Symantis user for the exchange of Myner Coins.

In the future, Myner Coins could translate into real world currency since they are the only form of currency allowed in the Symantis System. Symantis.org does not exchange real world currency for Myner Coins, but it also does not prohibit it. In fact, it encourages it to the level acceptable by the laws in your area.

Designers can contribute to Symantis by creating Design Elements and turning them into Manti. Developers can contribute to Symantis by creating Development Elements and turning them into Manti. Additionaly, designers and developers can work in "realtime" to create Manti. In turn, since the Symantis System works on a single beat, Designers and Developers are encouraged to learn the skillsets of their counterparts. Even non-designers and non-developers can contribute to Symantis, either by trading Myner Coins to have work completed or by investing in popular Manti and becoming seeders.

###What this means

This means you can create awesome good-will open source projects and get credit (possibly even physical credit) for your work.
